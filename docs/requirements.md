# Take-Home Challenge: React Native To-Do List Application

## **Problem Description:**

Please implement a simple To-Do List application with the following features:

1. **Add Tasks**: The user should be able to input a task and add it to the to-do list.
2. **Display Task List**: The task list should display all added tasks, with each task showing the task content and a checkbox.
3. **Mark Tasks as Complete**: The user should be able to mark a task as completed by clicking the checkbox. Completed tasks should be visually marked (e.g., text with a strikethrough).
4. **Delete Tasks**: The user should be able to delete completed tasks from the list.
5. **Data Persistence**: The task data should persist even when the application is closed.

## **Additional Requirements:**

- **UI and UX**: The interface should be simple, intuitive, and provide a good user experience.
- **Animation**: Implement reasonable animation effects to enhance the user experience. These could include animations for adding, completing, and deleting tasks, as well as any other transitions or effects that improve the app’s overall interactivity.
- **Performance Optimization**: The application should handle performance issues for long task lists.
- **Code Quality**: The code should be clean, maintainable, and well-structured, with components properly broken down.
- **Functional Testing**: Basic unit or integration tests should be written to verify the core functionality.

## **Submission Requirements:**

1. Submit the full source code files, including:
    - The React Native project source code
    - Any dependency files (e.g., `package.json`)
    - Necessary documentation or comments within the code
2. Provide a brief project document, which includes:
    - The tech stack used
    - Design decisions and rationale
    - How data persistence is implemented
3. Provide a runnable demo:
    - Please submit a demo using Expo or another method to run the application and demonstrate its functionality.

## Notes:

- The focus will be on **problem-solving skills**, **clarity of code**, and **efficiency** in solving the tasks.
- The questions are designed to evaluate both your technical knowledge and your ability to explain your approach.
